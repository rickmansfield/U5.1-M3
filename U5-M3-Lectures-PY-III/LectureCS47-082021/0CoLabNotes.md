## Objectives
- perform basic dictionary operations
- recognize mutable and immutable objects
- compare the time complexity of different approaches to a problem using Big O notation
- compare the space complexity of different approaches to a problem using Big O notation
- use list comprehensions

## Time Complexity
# Time Complexity
- Remember this for interviews
- This is not the be all and end all measure for performance
- Use this as a planning tool
- also use this when in your reflection phase of UPER
