# U5.1 M3 Sprint 1

## SPACE vs TIME
 ### __Space__ complexity
- focuses on memory additions  (how much space does it take up)
### __Time__ Complexity 
  - forucses on number of operation (how long to run them all)
  
## Todays Objectives
- Objective 01 - Perform basic dictionary operations
  - Resources

- Objective 03 - Compare the time complexity of different approaches to a problem using Big O notation
- Objective 04 - Compare the space complexity of different approaches to a problem using Big O notation
- Objective 05 - Use list comprehensions
