Constant O(1)	The runtime is entirely unaffected by the input size. This is the ideal solution.
Logarithmic O(log n)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow slightly slower. This is a pretty good solution.
Linear O(n)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at the same rate. This is a pretty good solution.
Polynomial O(n^c)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a faster rate. This might work for small inputs but is not a scalable solution.
Exponential O(c^n)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a much faster rate. This solution is inefficient.
Factorial O(n!)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow astronomically, even with relatively small inputs. This solution is exceptionally inefficient.
